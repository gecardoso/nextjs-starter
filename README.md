Helo! everybody ... I need collaboration to create an application that gets some information and, after a process, send a report to the user.
I want to develop using nextjs. I'm going to set up the pages and start a little logic ... so I would like some tips ... Thanks ...


## Getting Started


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
